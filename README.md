Hi, i'm the developer of the Ecto bot which is a FAQ bot made to make your life much easier by providing answers 
to FAQ that you ask no need to wait for a moderator to answer your question! 
and it's really good the only purpose of this account is for it's source code because you can't trust people these days with bots
as they may raid the server so i made this account to show that Ecto bot is safe
i may develop more things in the future if i do i'll update this profile.
